# Neptune 2016

# This is a preliminary Document and Still Subject to Revision

## Introduction

The course will include morning workshops on general computing skills based on the book [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://www.sinauer.com/practical-computing-for-biologists.html). These will be taught be [Casey Dunn](http://dunnlab.org), along with [August Guang] (a grad student in Casey's lab) with help from additional TAs. Morning workshops will be followed by afternoon workshops on specific applications of bioinformatics.

A few general notes about the course structure:

- Many details of the course are specific to UNIX-like operating systems, which include Linux and Apple OS X.

- Computationally intensive analyses will be conducted remotely on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) cloud computers.

- We will also use UNIX for local command line, programing, and data processing exercises. This means that it will not be possible to use Microsoft Windows alone for most course activities. If your primary laptop is Microsoft Windows, there are a couple options. We suggest that you borrow a Mac laptop for the course. Alternatively, if you prefer you can install Linux on a Virtual Machine and run it from within Windows.

- Course content, schedule, code, and other files will be distributed on [github](https://github.com). Course materials are available at [neptune2016](https://github.com/neptune2016).

- Course communication and coordination will take place on [slack](https://slack.com). 


## To do before you arrive

- Fill out the course survey (todo: casey will add link). This will be used to tailor the content to your interests and make decisions about how to run the course to best fit everyones' needs. *Please complete the survey by XXX*.

- Bring a copy of [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://www.sinauer.com/practical-computing-for-biologists.html) (abbreviated in this document as PCfB) and read "Before you Begin", Chapter 1, and Chapter 2. Also download an familiarize yourself with the [example files](http://practicalcomputing.org) provided at the [book website](http://practicalcomputing.org).

- Please an Ethernet adapter and Ethernet cable, as wifi access will be slow.

- Create a [github](https://github.com) account. If you use an academic email address, you may be eligible for free upgrades.

- Create an [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) account. You won't need to purchase anything for this class, but you will need a valid account to get access to the Amazon cloud computers we will use.

- Join the course [slack](https://slack.com) team. After you fill out the course survey, Casey will send you an invitation to the slack team.
